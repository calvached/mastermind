## Game Instructions

The CodeMaker will generate a random pattern with 4 of the following letters: A, B, C, D, E, F. Your job is to break the code (correct letters and  
correct order) with the least number of guesses. You will have a total of 10 pattern guesses each game. After each guess the CodeMaker will provide feedback by telling you how many guesses are correct in both letter and position and also how many guesses are the correct letter, but in the wrong position.

In order to submit a guess you must first enter 4 valid characters then press the [return] or [enter] key.
